# Comment-Matrix-Tool
An excel tool that processes R2T4 Calculations and populates notes. 
This tool was created for my work team in order to make our jobs easier and quicker. It combines two process into one and allows cases to be worked in less time and with fewer errors. It was created completely in excel and uses macros and VBA.

Each tab of the excel spreadsheet is setup to process each one of our case types. We enter the data needed and it calculates out what financial aid funds should be returned, and what funds the student is eligible to keep. It also creates the note to paste into the student account and shows what amounts to list in the email sent to the student. 

I created this over the course of 6 months as I had extra time at work. I coordinated testers and did a soft release to the team. There are still ongoing improvements to this tool.
